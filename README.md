# substrings

In this project, I implemented a substrings method that takes two arguments. The first is a word and the second is an array of substrings. It returns a hash of matching substrings along with the number of ocurrences of that particular substring. It is case insensitive.

Among the apparent skillset required to code, I learned:

* How to use pen and paper to plan code before writing it

* Use my knowledge to write pseudo-code on paper, making my code more clear and easier to follow

* Use a hash to clearly display results of the function

* Take into account various use-cases such as strings with punctuation and multiple words

* Utilize unique variable names even when writing variables with similar purposes to avoid conflicts in my code
